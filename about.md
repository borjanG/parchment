My name is Xinkai and I'm a Biostatistics PhD student at UCLA. If grad school days were recorded as $$n$$ dimensional vectors and I were to run a principle components analysis on my time, then statistics and music would be among my top PCs. For statistics, my research focuses on <span class="highlight-orange">statistical computing for massive datasets</span>. For music, I've been teaching myself piano and synthsesis. This site (```bLog(Likelihood)```) is about things that I'm learning in grad school: <span class="highlight-blue">math, statistics, machine learning, Julia</span> etc. That's it. Enjoy reading.
