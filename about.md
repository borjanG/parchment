I am a PhD student and Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellow at the <a href="http://www.uam.es/UAM/Home.htm?language=es">Universidad Autónoma de Madrid</a> since July 2018, under the supervision of <a href="http://paginaspersonales.deusto.es/enrique.zuazua/">Enrique Zuazua</a>. 
I am scheduled to defend my PhD thesis in April 2021. 
I am also affiliated with the <a href="https://cmc.deusto.eus">Chair of Computational Mathematics</a> at Fundación Deusto in Bilbao. 
My research has been centered on the analysis, control and applications of partial differential equations with moving interfaces (free boundaries), and more recently, on the applications of control theoretical paradigms to deep learning, using analytical and probabilistic tools, within a multidisciplinary approach drawing concepts and techniques from computer science, statistics, and applied mathematics.

I obtained a BSc (2016, cum laude) in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, as well as an MSc (2018, summa cum laude) in Applied Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.u-bordeaux.fr">University of Bordeaux</a>.
